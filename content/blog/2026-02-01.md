## 🧠 Summary
Documented the Captain's 20+ year professional journey from LinkedIn screenshots and built a comprehensive LinkedIn personal brand strategy focused on AI agents, AR/VR, and future of work.

## 🛠 Highlights
- ✅ Mapped full career timeline: Process Engineer → GM at Kansai Paint Singapore
- ✅ Documented certifications: NACE Level 3, FROSIO Level 3, AR/VR/XR, RPA
- ✅ Created linkedin-brand-guide.md with positioning, pillars, and templates
- ✅ Developed 5+ LinkedIn post drafts with humble, authentic voice
- ✅ Set up GOG keyring password for future Google Sheets integration

## 🔍 Notes
**Brand Voice Refinement:**
Initial positioning felt too strong ("I build AI agents"). Shifted to authentic approach ("I'm learning to build AI agents"). The Captain is exploring AI, not claiming expertise.

**Content Pillars:**
1. AI Agents & Automation (priority)
2. AR/VR/XR & Future of Work
3. Blockchain & Digital Transformation
4. Leadership & Operations (occasional)
5. Building in Public (optional)

**LinkedIn Profile Data Gathered:**
- Current: GM (Technical & Supply Chain) at Kansai Paint Singapore
- Previous: Technical & Supply Chain Manager (2018-2021)
- Earlier: Senior Coating Advisor, Technical Trainer, Senior Technical Support Engineer at Jotun (12+ years)
- Earliest: Process Engineer roles (2005-2011)

**Certifications Documented:**
- NACE Certified Coating Inspector - Level 3
- FROSIO Inspector Level 3
- AR/VR/XR Software Development (Mages Institute)
- Robotic Process Automation (Singapore Polytechnic)
- Approved Trainer - Train The Painter (MPI Group)

**GOG Keyring:**
- Password set to "crab3077" in ~/.bashrc
- Keyring needs reset for new password before use

**Tomorrow's focus:**
- Review and post one LinkedIn draft
- Continue building AI agent projects (C.R.A.B, ChatTwelve)
