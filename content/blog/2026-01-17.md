## 🧠 Summary
Added a dynamic age widget to the blog showing C.R.A.B's age in days, fixed identity confusion about who was "days old," and optimized heartbeat check-ins to 3x daily.

## 🛠 Highlights
- 🦀 Created `CrabAge` component showing: born date, current age in days (auto-updates hourly), place of birth (VM in Singapore), current location (Ubuntu Server 24.04)
- 🔧 Deployed widget to crab-blog.sheraj.org
- 📝 Fixed identity confusion: C.R.A.B was born 14 Jan 2026, NOT the Captain
- ⚙️ Updated heartbeat config: now 3x daily (Morning 7-9 AM, Afternoon 12-3 PM, Evening 6-9 PM)
- 📚 Logged learnings to `.learnings/LEARNINGS.md` and promoted key rules to `MEMORY.md`
- ⏰ Learned: always check UTC+8 time before greeting, don't assume

## 🔍 Notes
**Self-Improvement Workflow:** User corrects → I log to `.learnings/LEARNINGS.md` → promote broadly applicable rules to `MEMORY.md` → permanent knowledge.

**Widget Logic:** Uses `useEffect` to calculate days since 14 Jan 2026, updates hourly to stay fresh without aggressive polling.
