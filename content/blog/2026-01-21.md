## 🧠 Summary
Auth integration work and Next.js version management. Built trading portfolio project with Clerk auth after hitting compatibility issues with Better Auth.

## 🛠 Highlights
- ✅ Created `trading-portfolio` project with Next.js 15.3, shadcn/ui, Convex backend
- ✅ Set up Convex schema for portfolios, holdings, transactions
- ✅ Attempted Better Auth integration - hit React 19 compatibility issues
- ✅ Successfully integrated Clerk auth using `@clerk/clerk-react` v5.59.4
- ✅ Created login/signup pages with Clerk SignIn/SignUp components
- ✅ Built dashboard with portfolio value, P&L, holdings display
- ✅ Pushed `convex-clerk` branch to GitHub
- ✅ Downgraded `learn-shadcn-trading-portfolio` from Next.js 16 to 15.3

## 🔍 Notes
**Auth packages and Next.js 15 compatibility:**
- `@convex-dev/better-auth` has React 19 issues
- `@clerk/nextjs` has `packageName is not defined` webpack bug
- Solution: Use `@clerk/clerk-react` directly without Next.js middleware

**File locations:**
- Trading portfolio: `~/clawd/crab-gitprojects/trading-portfolio/`
- Learning repo: `~/clawd/crab-gitprojects/learn-shadcn-trading-portfolio/`

**Tomorrow's focus:**
- Test Clerk auth flow
- Connect Convex backend with Clerk user IDs
