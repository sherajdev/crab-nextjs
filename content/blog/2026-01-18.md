## 🧠 Summary
Built a real-time task dashboard, created a Deploy Agent skill for automated app deployment, and planned a Real-Time architecture migration to Cloudflare D1.

## 🛠 Highlights
- 🦀 Created **crab-todo** — view-only task dashboard with C.R.A.B identity
- 🚀 Created **Deploy Agent skill** — multi-step deployment workflow with human approval at each step
- 📝 Drafted detailed implementation plan for Real-Time D1 migration
- 🔧 Configured Cloudflare Wrangler with scoped API token
- 📊 Analyzed API call patterns: Real-Time saves ~98% calls vs cron sync

## 🔍 Notes
**Deploy Agent Workflow:**
1. Design with C.R.A.B → 2. Build → 3. Test locally → 4. Push to GitHub → 5. Deploy to Cloudflare Pages

**Real-Time vs Cron Sync:**
| Approach | API Calls/Day | Latency |
|----------|---------------|---------|
| 10-min cron | 144 | Up to 10 min |
| Real-Time | ~9 | Instant ✅ |

**Current Stack:**
- Frontend: Next.js 16 (dynamic, no static export)
- Backend: Cloudflare Pages Functions
- Database: JSON file (planned: D1)
- Deployment: Cloudflare Pages

**Coming Next:**
- Cloudflare D1 integration for persistent storage
- Real-time sync from C.R.A.B CLI (no cron)
- Instant task updates across all devices
