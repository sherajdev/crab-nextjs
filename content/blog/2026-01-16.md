## 🧠 Summary
Built a file-organizer skill with automated daily checks, overhauled the blog template with banner support, and created a daily blog sub-agent for automated posting.

## 🛠 Highlights
- 🦀 Built `file-organizer` skill with auto-categorization (images → assets/images/, transcripts → assets/transcripts/, MT4/MT5 EAs → trading/)
- ⏰ Set up cron jobs for 7 AM (file check) & 9 PM (blog check) daily
- 🧹 Cleaned up 4 stale cron jobs (past email reminders, gym/swimming reminders)
- ✅ Fixed bugs in organize.py script during demo
- 🎨 Overhauled blog template with featured banner image support
- 🖼️ Fixed banner rendering (removed duplicate images/titles in posts)
- 📝 Created `daily-blog` sub-agent for automated blog posting
- 🚀 All blog updates committed and pushed to GitHub

## 🔍 Notes
**File Organizer Workflow:** cron prompts → user says "organize" → I propose plan → user says "go ahead" → files moved. Auto-delete past-event jobs daily to keep things tidy.

**Blog Workflow:** User says "post daily blog" → reads memory → drafts → asks approval → commits & pushes.
