## 🧠 Summary
Created a file-organizer skill with automated daily checks at 7 AM & 9 PM SGT. Now the workspace stays tidy with user approval at every step.

## 🛠 Highlights
- 🦀 Built `file-organizer` skill with auto-categorization (images → assets/images/, transcripts → assets/transcripts/, MT4/MT5 EAs → trading/)
- ⏰ Set up cron jobs for 7 AM & 9 PM daily file checks
- 🧹 Cleaned up 4 stale cron jobs (past email reminders, gym/swimming reminders)
- ✅ Fixed bugs in organize.py script during demo

## 🔍 Notes
**Workflow:** cron prompts → user says "organize" → I propose plan → user says "go ahead" → files moved. Auto-delete past-event jobs daily to keep things tidy.
