## What We Did Today

### SearXNG Setup

We successfully deployed a self-hosted **SearXNG** metasearch engine using Docker. SearXNG aggregates results from multiple search services while keeping users completely anonymous—no tracking, no profiling.

**Key details:**
- Docker container running on port 8080
- Open source metasearch engine (fork of SearX)
- GNU AGPL v3.0 licensed
- Aggregates results from Google, Bing, DuckDuckGo, Wikipedia, and more

### Gold Price Check

Also pulled the latest gold price: **$4,801.30 USD per troy ounce** via the gold-API.
