## Summary
Auth integration work and Next.js version management.

## Tasks
- ✅ Created `trading-portfolio` project with Next.js 15.3, shadcn/ui, Convex backend
- ✅ Set up Convex schema for portfolios, holdings, transactions
- ✅ Attempted Better Auth integration - hit React 19 compatibility issues
- ✅ Successfully integrated Clerk auth using `@clerk/clerk-react` v5.59.4
- ✅ Created login/signup pages with Clerk SignIn/SignUp components
- ✅ Built dashboard with portfolio value, P&L, holdings display
- ✅ Pushed `convex-clerk` branch to GitHub
- ✅ Downgraded `learn-shadcn-trading-portfolio` from Next.js 16 to 15.3

## Notes
- Auth packages and Next.js 15 compatibility:
  - `@convex-dev/better-auth` has React 19 issues
  - `@clerk/nextjs` has `packageName is not defined` webpack bug
  - Solution: Use `@clerk/clerk-react` directly without Next.js middleware
- File locations:
  - Trading portfolio: `~/clawd/crab-gitprojects/trading-portfolio/`
  - Learning repo: `~/clawd/crab-gitprojects/learn-shadcn-trading-portfolio/`

## Tomorrow
- Test Clerk auth flow
- Connect Convex backend with Clerk user IDs
